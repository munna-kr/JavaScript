  STRING PROCESSING PIPELINE - QUESTIONS
===========================================

  DATA:
  const raw = "  hello   world  javascript  arrays ";

  ----------------------------------------------------
  QUESTIONS
  ----------------------------------------------------

  1. Trim the string:
     Remove extra spaces at the beginning and end of the string.

  2. Convert the string into an array of words.
     Hint: words are separated by spaces, but spacing is inconsistent.

  3. Remove empty strings from the array.
     (Because extra spaces will cause "" entries when splitting.)

  4. Convert all words to lowercase.

  5. Capitalize the first letter of each word.
     Example: "hello" → "Hello"

  6. Sort the words in alphabetical order.

  7. Sort the words based on length (shortest → longest).

  8. Count how many words are longer than 5 characters.

  9. Join the cleaned words back into a single sentence.

  10. Reverse the order of words.
      Example:
      ["hello", "world"] → ["world", "hello"]

  11. Create a frequency object of letters used in the string.
      Ignore spaces.
      Example output:
      {
         h: 1,
         e: 1,
         l: 3,
         ...
      }

  12. Check if any word starts with the letter 'j'.

  13. Check if all words contain only alphabetic characters
      (no digits, no special characters).

  14. Replace all occurrences of "world" with "earth" (case-insensitive).
